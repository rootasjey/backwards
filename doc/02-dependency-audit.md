   - Risk: Medium
   - Benefits: Modern build system, better performance, active maintenance

2. **Update TypeScript to 5.x**
   - Effort: 1-2 days
   - Risk: Medium
   - Benefits: Better type checking, modern features, security fixes

### Phase 2: Core Dependencies (Priority 2)
3. **Update Phaser to 3.80.x**
   - Effort: 1-2 days
   - Risk: Low-Medium
   - Benefits: Bug fixes, performance improvements, security patches

4. **Update ESLint to 9.x**
   - Effort: 1 day
   - Risk: Low
   - Benefits: Security fixes, better performance

### Phase 3: Development Tools (Priority 3)
5. **Update AVA to 6.x**

   - Risk: Low
   - Benefits: Better TypeScript integration

## Recommended Target Versions

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "pathfinding": "0.4.18",
    "phaser": "^3.80.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/pathfinding": "^0.0.4",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^8.15.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^8.15.0",
    "ava": "^6.1.3",
    "eslint": "^9.15.0",
    "typescript": "^5.6.3",

    "@vitejs/plugin-typescript": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Migration Risks and Mitigation

### High-Risk Changes
1. **Snowpack → Vite**: Complete build system change
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, maintain parallel builds during transition
   
2. **TypeScript 3.9 → 5.6**: Stricter type checking
   - **Mitigation**: Update incrementally, fix type issues systematically

### Medium-Risk Changes
1. **Phaser 3.24 → 3.80**: API changes possible
   - **Mitigation**: Review changelog, test thoroughly, update deprecated APIs

### Testing Strategy
1. Create comprehensive test suite before migration
2. Set up automated testing pipeline
3. Test on multiple browsers and devices
4. Performance benchmarking before/after

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- **Development Time**: 5-8 days total
- **Testing Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk of Regression**: Medium

### Benefits
- **Security**: Elimination of known vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: 20-30% build time improvement
- **Maintainability**: Modern tooling and features
- **Future-Proofing**: Compatibility with modern ecosystem
- **Developer Experience**: Better debugging, faster development

## Conclusion

The dependency modernization is **critical** and should be prioritized immediately. The current state poses security risks and limits development efficiency. The recommended migration strategy balances risk with benefits and provides a clear path forward.
